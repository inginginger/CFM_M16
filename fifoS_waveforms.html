<h2><CENTER>Sample behavioral waveforms for design file fifoS.v </CENTER></h2>
<P>The following waveforms show the behavior of scfifo megafunction for the chosen set of parameters in design fifoS.v.  The design fifoS.v has a depth of 2 words of 8 bits each. The fifo is in show-ahead synchronous mode.  The data becomes available before 'rdreq' is asserted; 'rdreq' acts as a read acknowledge. </P>
